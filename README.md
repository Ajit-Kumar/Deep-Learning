Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Learning

Pixel-wise image segmentation is a well-studied problem in medical domain. The task of semantic image segmentation is to classify each pixel in the image. 
❖ Input: Images
❖ Output: Recognizing, understanding what is in the image in pixel level. Assign a class
label to each pixel (Semantic Segmentation), but do not differentiate instances.

Data Understanding
Dataset details are mentioned below:
❖ total of 560 images of size 512x512 in png format.
❖ 280 images of normal tissue (colour mode ‘RGBA’)
❖ 280 images of annotation mask. (colour mode ‘P’)
❖ For each normal tissue there is annotation mask.
❖ Image annotation was done using semantic segmentation techniques.
❖ It has four classes
