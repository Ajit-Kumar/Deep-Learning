Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Learning

Pixel-wise image segmentation is a well-studied problem in medical domain. The task of semantic image segmentation is to classify each pixel in the image. 
❖ Input: Images
❖ Output: Recognizing, understanding what is in the image in pixel level. Assign a class
label to each pixel (Semantic Segmentation), but do not differentiate instances.
